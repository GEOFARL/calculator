# Calculator :ghost:

This calculator was made during accomplishing **The Odin Project**. In the process of making this project I've learned a bunch of new cool features of JS, so I definitely recommend to try out sth similar for traversing the world of WebProgramming.

Now, go ahead and play with it. It supports _keyboard input_, has _history log_ and you **_can use it on mobile devices!_**
